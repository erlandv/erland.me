  "desc": "I planned and executed a provider-to-provider migration of a CRM system to GCP. The new foundation was defined in Terraform for consistent and reviewable changes. Workloads were containerized and deployed to GKE with environment-specific configuration and secrets management.\n\n I set up cluster logging, metrics, and alerting to give the operations team clear visibility. Cutover used a staged data sync and a short maintenance window to minimize downtime.",
  "highlights": [
    "GCP build-out with Terraform: networks, IAM, storage, and managed services",
    "GKE deployment: containerized CRM with configuration and secrets per environment",
    "Observability: GKE logging and metrics plus Prometheus exporters and alerting",
    "Migration playbook: staged data sync, verification steps, and a rollback plan",
    "Security and compliance: service accounts with least privilege, encryption at rest and in transit"

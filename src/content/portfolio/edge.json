  "desc": "I collaborated on layout, visual styling, and on-page copy, then translated the Figma designs into a responsive, accessible frontend. To reach international audiences, I added full multilingual support (language switcher, content loading, URL handling).\n\n I also built a contact form that routes messages straight to the company’s customer-service inbox to speed up support. After QA on staging, I handled the migration and go-live, ensuring a clean cutover and stable performance.",

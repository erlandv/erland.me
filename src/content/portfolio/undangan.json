  "desc": "I created a web-based wedding invitation system focused on usability for non-technical users. Hosts can manage guest wishes and attendance from a central dashboard, reply to messages, and keep their guest list tidy.\n\n The site supports per-guest invitation links using query parameters and automatically generates QR codes for check-in. A templating layer and GUI let users change names, dates, venues, photos, and colors without touching code. I documented the full setup and extension points so other developers can adopt and evolve the platform.",

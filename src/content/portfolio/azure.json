  "desc": "I built a greenfield Azure environment using Infrastructure as Code with Terraform to support remote patient monitoring. The baseline covered network segmentation, private endpoints, key management, and automated backups.\n\n I then implemented a CI/CD pipeline for the mobile app to streamline releases: automated builds, tests, signing, artifact storage, and gated promotions to the stores. The stack follows HIPAA-aligned practices with RBAC, least privilege, encryption in transit and at rest, and audit logging to protect PHI.",

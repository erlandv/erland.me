  "desc": "Writenex is a collection of tools for modern Markdown editing and content management. I designed and developed both the standalone Markdown editor application and an Astro integration package that allows content creators and developers to manage and edit Markdown/MDX content directly within an Astro project workflow.\n\n The editor is offline-first and progressive, with a smooth writing experience that works in the browser. The Astro package integrates with Astro content collections so users can visually edit content that feeds directly into static sites, blogs, or documentation sites. I also managed documentation, packaging, and publishing processes to make sure the tools are easy to adopt and extend.",

  "desc": "I built Virex as a customizable Astro theme that helps developers launch professional SaaS landing pages with rich content support out of the box. The project includes blog, docs, changelog, and testimonial content collections that integrate with Astro’s routing and content APIs.\n\n I designed and implemented accessible components, SEO-friendly metadata (Open Graph, JSON-LD, Twitter cards), dark mode support, Tailwind CSS utility styling, and feature flags to let users toggle site sections easily. Virex aims to be both a ready template for quick deployment and a flexible foundation for further customization.",

  "desc": "Virex is a production-ready SaaS UI theme I built to help developers launch modern SaaS products faster—from marketing pages to dashboard interfaces. The project is designed as a solid starting point for SaaS builders who want a consistent UI foundation without starting from scratch.\n\n It includes fully structured marketing pages, a reusable dashboard layout with example pages, and rich content support using Astro Content Collections for blogs, documentation, changelogs, and testimonials. All parts are built to integrate cleanly with Astro’s routing, content APIs, and TypeScript-first workflow.\n\n I designed and implemented accessible UI components, SEO-ready metadata (Open Graph, JSON-LD, Twitter Cards), dark mode with system preference support, and a feature-flag system that allows sections to be enabled or disabled easily. Virex balances speed of setup with long-term flexibility, making it suitable both as a ready-to-use template and as a customizable foundation for real-world SaaS projects.",
